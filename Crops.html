   <p>This Food crop was invented in America by a great scintist and a software engeneer by the name Atieno Allela
   from Canada. The crop was first used as animal feed but after great research it was recognised to be good for human
   consuption since it is rich in minerals and providing the body with ability to continue growing.The
   plant is good especially in our land since it does not require a lot of rainfall for it to mature and be harvested.
   My urge to you is that you find how you can grow this crop since its good in deed</p>
